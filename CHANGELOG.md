# Meme Coin Bot CHANGELOG

## Version 1.0.0 (2025-04-03)

### Major Changes

#### Fixed Broken Modules
- **Solana Scanner**
  - Corrected Helius API URL format from `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com/020da7f45b05497f951bc2218489ee73` to `https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=020da7f45b05497f951bc2218489ee73`
  - Replaced random data generation with real API calls for token volume, price, holders, and buy/sell ratio
  - Implemented proper contract safety checks

- **Ethereum Scanner**
  - Fixed RPC authentication error handling
  - Replaced hardcoded ETH price with real-time price from CoinGecko API
  - Implemented real data retrieval for token volume, holders, and buy/sell ratio

- **Telegram Integration**
  - Updated channel ID from "your_telegram_channel_id" to "MeMeMasterBotSignals"
  - Added proper error handling for Telegram API calls
  - Improved message formatting with rich content

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching System**
  - Added Redis-based caching with TTL for frequently accessed data
  - Implemented in-memory fallback cache when Redis is unavailable
  - Created cache decorator for easy application to API calls

- **Parallel Processing**
  - Implemented asyncio-based parallel token scanning
  - Added semaphore-based concurrency control to prevent overloading APIs
  - Optimized database operations with bulk updates

- **Error Handling**
  - Added exponential backoff retry logic for all API calls
  - Implemented circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
  - Added fallback mechanisms for critical operations

#### Enhanced Scoring and Filtering
- **Scoring Algorithm**
  - Refactored scoring system with weighted factors
  - Added logarithmic scaling for appropriate metrics
  - Implemented momentum scoring based on buy/sell ratio

- **Filtering Capabilities**
  - Added liquidity threshold filter
  - Implemented contract safety checks
  - Added honeypot detection

### Project Structure Changes
- Reorganized project into clearly structured folders:
  - `/scanners`: Blockchain scanners (Ethereum, Solana)
  - `/filters`: Token filtering logic
  - `/signals`: Signal generation
  - `/scoring`: Token scoring algorithms
  - `/telegram`: Telegram bot integration
  - `/utils`: Utility functions (caching, retry logic)

### Configuration Changes
- Updated `.env.example` with comprehensive configuration options
- Added new environment variables:
  - `REDIS_URL`: For Redis caching
  - `COINGECKO_API_KEY`: For price data
  - `SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS`: For scanner timing
  - `MAX_CONCURRENT_SCANS`: For parallel processing control
  - `MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY_USD`: For filtering
  - `SIGNAL_COOLDOWN_MINUTES`: For rate limiting

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with detailed setup and usage instructions
- Added performance_summary.md with benchmark comparisons
- Created CHANGELOG.md to track project changes

### Dependencies
- Added Redis client for caching
- Added aiohttp for async HTTP requests
